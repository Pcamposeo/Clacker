# Clacker
Clacker is a game in which a user must roll 2 die, and click either the numbers on each die, or the sum. 
If neither are available the user must click nothing and roll again. The goal is to click all numbers in the least amount of rolls possible. 

This was a High School project using introductory Object-Oriented coding concepts, along with a GUI.
